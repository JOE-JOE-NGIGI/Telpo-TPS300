# Telpo-TPS300

Contains Useful code examples to get a programmer started with the TPS300 series.

Contents:
1. Compilation instruction for C++. C is said to be supported by default. I strongly **defer**  with those guys, as I'm more confortable with C++ and alas there's a C++ compiler in the SDK. And with C++ you can produce less executable size than (why? less code), ofcourse iff you really know C++.
2. Compilation instructions for third party Libraries. If you want to use third party libraries in your development
3. Code examples with Code::Blocks project files. Now is a good time to download and Learn Code::Blocks

Some dependencies used in extending capabilities, e.g C++11 nullptr support from ETL
1. ArduinoJson
2. ETL (Embedded Template Library)
